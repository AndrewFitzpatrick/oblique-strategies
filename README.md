oblique-strategies
==================

Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt's [oblique strategies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies) as a very simple node module.

## Usage

```javascript
var oblique = require('oblique-strategies');

console.log(oblique.draw()); // one strategy
console.log(oblique.strategies); // all of the strategies in alpha order
```

The module will also install a bin script called `strategy`.
